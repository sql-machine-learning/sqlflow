# Running SQLFlow on Kubernetes

This is a tutorial on how to run SQLFlow on Kubernetes, and this tutorial will deploy:
- A MySQL server instance with some example data loaded,
- The SQLFlow gRPC server, and 
- The Jupyter Notebook server with SQLFlow magic command installed.

Then you can run the SQLFlow query in the Jupyter notebook on your web browser.

## Prerequisites

1. Setup a Kubernetes cluster: You can refer to the [official page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup) to set up a 
full cluster or use a local quick start tool: [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
This tutorial would use [minikube] to demonstrate the SQLFlow.
1. [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/), which is the command line tool
to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
1. Make sure the Kubernetes nodes can pull the official SQLFlow Docker image [sqlflow/sqlflow:latest] or your [custom
Docker image](/doc/build.md).

## Deploy the SQLFlow Components

1. Deploy the SQLFlow Pod on Kubernetes
    ``` bash
    > kubectl create -f k8s/sqlflow-mysql.yaml
    ```
    The above command starts a Pod with three containers, they running the `sqlflow/sqlflow:latest` Docker image,
    one container runs the MySQL server instance and the other two run the SQLFlow gRPC server and the
    Jupyter Notebook server. You can also use your custom Docker image by editing the `image` fields of the yaml
    file [k8s/sqlflow-mysql.yaml](/doc/k8s/sqlflow-mysql.yaml):
    ``` yaml
    spec:
        ...
        containers:
        - image: <your repo name>/sqlflow:latest
    ```

1. Testing your SQLFlow setup
    You can find a Pod on Kubernetes with the prefix `sqlflow-mysql-*`:
    ``` bash
    > kubectl get pods
    NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    sqlflow-mysql-77f8674899-dv269   2/2     Running   0          75m
    ```
    The logs of the two containers similar to:
    ``` bash
    > kubectl logs sqlflow-mysql-77f8674899-dv269 mysql
     * Starting MySQL database server mysqld
       ...done.
    > kubectl logs sqlflow-mysql-77f8674899-dv269 sqlflow
    Connect to the datasource mysql://root:root@tcp(10.100.73.238:3306)/?maxAllowedPacket=0
    2019/05/30 09:57:55 Server Started at :50051
    ```

## Running your Query in SQLFlow 

1. Copy the node IP of the sqlflow Pod on minikube as the follows command:
    ``` bash
    > minikube ip
    192.168.99.100
    ```
    **NOTE**: If you are using a **real** cluster, you can find the node domain/IP from the `NODE` column
    using`kubectl get pods -o wide`:
    ``` bash
    > kubectl get pods -o wide
    NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP   NODE    NOMINATED   NODE    READINESS   GATES
    sqlflow-mysql-77f8674899-dv269  2/2    Running  0   9s  172.17.0.4  minikube   <none>           <none>
    ```

1. Open a web browser and go to '<node-ip>:8888', you can find the [SQLFlow example](/example/jupyter/example.ipynb) in the Jupyter notebook file lists.
