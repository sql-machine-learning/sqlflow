# Workflow

## Motivation

SQLFlow translates a SQL program, perhaps with extended SQL syntax for AI, into a workflow. Currently, it translates a SQL program into a Python program.

Programming languages are a natural solution to workflow description. However, we want another way of workflow description because we want to force users to declare steps and their dependencies explicitly. Given such information, we could identify shared parts between workflows, which might come from a user or different users, and remove redundant executions of the shared components.

A secondary motivation is to identify steps that could run simultaneously from dependency analysis. Or, in short, to improve concurrency of the execution of a workflow.

## Related Work

### Programming Languages

Programming languages are the most intuitive way to describe a workflow. And, they can define pretty complex workflows. The minimum computational unit in programming languages is some primitive built-in functions and operators.  For AI system developers, most workflows consist of steps with a certain granularity -- a job running on Kubernetes.  It is true that the language runtime, i.e., the compilers and interpreters, often optimize the execution of the "workflow" by concurrently running primitives, but they don't parallelize jobs.

We prefer the intuitive description of workflows provided by programming languages, but we need to define a certain granularity as steps.

### TensorFlow

TensorFlow is a deep learning system, which allows users to describe a computation process known as the *forward pass*, and runs an algorithm known as *autodiff* to derive the *backward pass* automatically from the forward pass.

TensorFlow 1.x represents the computation process by a data structure known as a *graph*, whose each node is a step, known as a *TensorFlow operation*.

We prefer the workflow engine represents each workflow as a data structure or something similar, so we can identify shared parts among multiple graphs, and merge various workflows into a big one without redundant components.

### Google Tangent

Tangent is another deep learning system developed by Google. In contrast to TensorFlow, it represents the computation process by Python source code, other than a graph.

Tangent does autodiff by parsing the Python source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST), adding the backward steps into the AST tree, and printing the AST tree into a new snippet of Python code.

We like the capability of describing the computation process by a program.  Tangent doesn't support all Python syntax used in the description of the forward pass. Similarly, we might not allow all Python syntax used to describe the workflow if we follow the Tangent way.  The steps in Tangent include some pre-listed functions, mostly, TensorFlow operations, and Python operators.

## Concepts

Some base jobs.

WorkflowParam represents intermediate values passed between steps, and can also be used to find out dependencies. (name, owner_step, type).
How inputs/outputs are supported in Argo now?

```python
# Base job
class BaseJob(object):
    def __init__(
        self,
        name: str,
        inputs: List[WorkflowParam],
        outputs: List[WorkflowParam],
        retry: int,
        timeout: int,
    ):
        # Create a new instance of BaseJob


# Single container job
class ContainerJob(BaseJob):
    def __init__(
        self,
        name: str,
        image: str,
        command: str,
        args: str,
        **kwargs,
    ):
        # Create a new instance of ContainerJob
        

# A k8s resource job
class ResourceJob(BaseJob):
    def __init__(
        self,
        name: str,
        success_condition: str,
        failure_condition: str,
        **kwargs,
    ):
        # Create a new instance of ResourceJob

```

**Branching**
```python
step1 = self.create_step1()
step2 = self.create_step2()
step3 = self.create_step3()

output1 = self.run(step1, args1)
if output1.field_a == 0:
    self.run(step2, args2)
else:
    self.run(step3, args3)
```

**Static loop**
```python
step1 = self.create_step1()
step2 = self.create_step2()

self.run(step1)
for x in ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]:
    self.run(step2, x)
```

**Dynamic loop**

```python
step1 = self.create_step1()
step2 = self.create_step2()

while output and output != "head":
    output = self.run(step1, args1)

self.run(step2, args2)
```
