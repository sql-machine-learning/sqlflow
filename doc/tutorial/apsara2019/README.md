# APSARA Conference 2019

## Overview

This directory contains tutorials presented in the [APSARA Conference 2019](https://www.alibabacloud.com/apsara-conference-2019). In these tutorials, we will learn how to

- Train a DNN model on the [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), then use the trained model to predict on testing data.
- Train an XGBoost model on the [Car Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), then use the trained model to predict on the test data. Explain the trained model using [SHAP EXPLAINER](https://github.com/slundberg/shap).
- Train a cluster model on the [Active Power Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/electric-power-consumption-data-set), then explore different patterns on the clustered data.

## Quick Start

It's quite simple to try out SQLFlow using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).

1. Install [Docker Community Edition](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
2. Run SQLflow by typing the command `docker run -it -p 8888:8888 sqlflow/sqlflow:didi`.
3. Access localhost:8888 in your Web browser.
4. Open the one of the IPython Notebook and run all cells.
